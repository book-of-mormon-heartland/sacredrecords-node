            "4 The people of that place, being of the Anishinaabeg — Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi — came forth in their canoes of birch-bark, for they had heard tidings of a man whose words burned as the sun at dawn.",
            "5 They spake one to another, saying, Could this be the Dawn-Bringer of the winter prophecies, who shall open the way of light?",

"17 But the vessel without light is as driftwood, carried whithersoever the current taketh it.",
"18 An elder named Migizi said, Master, how may we stand as this stone?",
"19 Yahawzhowaa answered, By setting thy foundation upon the Father’s word, and by keeping thy vessel clean, that the light may dwell within and not depart.",

"3 In his hands he bare two tablets of red stone, smooth and polished, yet graven with signs of ancient making.",

"12 But in the days appointed, One shall come to open the covering and pour in the flame from the lodge of heaven.",
"13 Aganabish said, Our elders taught that this One would have power over the winds and the waters.",
"14 Yahawzhowaa answered, Ye have seen these things with thine own eyes; yet greater than these is the gift of the Father’s light, which none can take away.",
"15 For I am the Keeper of the Flame, and I pour it freely into the vessel that is ready.",
"16 He pointed to a carving of the sun upon the tablets, saying, This is the vessel full of light: its path is straight, its shadow is none, and its end is life without end.",
"17 And He pointed to a carving of the moon darkened, saying, This is the vessel empty of light: it wandereth, its path is crooked, and its end is the lodge of silence.",
"18 Then Yahawzhowaa lifted the tablets before the people, and said, This witness ye have kept is true; it is fulfilled in your hearing this day.",
"19 Whoso hath ears to hear, let him hear: the Father’s fire is not given to be hidden, but to shine forth that all may be drawn unto it.",
"20 He gave the tablets again to Aganabish, saying, Guard them still, yet know that the greater tablet is within thee, where the Father writeth His word.",
